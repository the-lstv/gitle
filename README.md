# gitle
Gitle is my spin on git, supposed to be less of a pain to deal with.<br>
Unlike git, it is not suited for big or comercial products, only small personal projects by a single person.<br><br>
So what is it?<br>
All this is is a small program/library that helps you to sync up code across devices, where you can instantly propagate changes to a server.<br>
It is compatible with .gitignore (and that is about it)<br><br>
I mostly made it for my own needs. The code is not maintained to be too readable or customizable as a final product. Use on your own risk.
